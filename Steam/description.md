I got the idea for this mod from a friend who requested it. After doing some research online and not finding an easy way to use this in-game, I decided to make it myself.
I wrote most of the code myself, though I took inspiration from some similar scripts I found online.

At the moment the mods supports a few of arma 3 base vehicles and most of the Mraps from RHSUSAF.
