I got the idea for this mod from a friend who requested it. After doing some research online and not finding an easy way to use this in-game, I decided to make it myself.
I wrote most of the code myself, though I took inspiration from some similar scripts I found online.

	[*]Sometimes the explosions all occur at the end of the rope. FYI: Tensioning the rope by backing up a meter or two usually fixes it.

[h2]List of supported Vehicles[/h2]
At the moment, the mod supports a few Arma 3 base vehicles and most of the MRAPs from RHSUSAF.
If you want to add your own custom vehicle, you can create a compatibility addon or submit a pull request on the public [url=https://github.com/alezm00/Miclic] github page [/url]
